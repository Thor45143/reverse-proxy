Scan QR code from your terminal using Tonkeeper, Tonhub or any other wallet, execute transaction. Your domain will be linked to your site.

###### Run without domain
Alternatively, you can run in simple mode, with .adnl domain, if you don't have .ton or .t.me domain:
```
./tonutils-reverse-proxy-linux-amd64
```

##### Use
Now anyone can access your TON Site! Using ADNL address or domain. 

If you want to change some settings, like proxy pass url - open `config.json` file, edit and restart proxy. Default proxy pass url is `http://127.0.0.1:80/`

Proxy adds additional headers:
`X-Adnl-Ip` - ip of client, and `X-Adnl-Id` - adnl id of client

### Installation on any other OS

Build it from sources using `./build.sh`, and run as in the step 2 for linux. Go environment is required to build.
